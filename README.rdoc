Cash4Trash

This is a final project for the NEXT Academy Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp for the team of Chow Zhi Yuan, Chai Wei Jun and Andy Chong.

This project aims to make recycling fun, easy and rewarding.

Users can use this app to schedule times where recyclable trash can be picked up from their homes in exchange for points and achievements.

This project notably helped us learn about different user groups, user interface segregation for different users and jQuery implementation.
